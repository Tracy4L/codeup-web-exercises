// Sure, here are some coding exercises for beginners. These exercises cover various programming concepts and are suitable for beginners with little to no programming experience. They are designed to help you get familiar with basic programming principles and logic. The exercises are in Python, a beginner-friendly language, but you can use any programming language of your choice.
//
//     Exercise 1: Hello World
// Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// Step 1:(understand what it means to print)
console.log('Hello World')
//     Exercise 2: Even or Odd
// Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it's even or odd.
// Step 1: What is an(Interger)
// Step 2: What are ways to print inputs.

Function isInterger(input){



}
//
// Exercise 3: Sum of Digits
// Write a program that takes a positive integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits.
//
//     Exercise 4: FizzBuzz
// Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
//
//     Exercise 5: Factorial
// Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer.
//
//     Exercise 6: Palindrome Check
// Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Ignore spaces, capitalization, and punctuation.
//
//     Exercise 7: Prime Numbers
// Write a program that takes a positive integer as input and determines whether it's a prime number or not.
//
// Exercise 8: List Manipulation
// Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and performs the following operations:
//
//     Print the length of the list.
//     Print the largest and smallest numbers in the list.
//     Print the sum of all numbers in the list.
//     Exercise 9: Temperature Converter
// Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The program should ask the user to enter a temperature and the unit of the temperature (C or F) and then convert it to the other unit.
//
//     Exercise 10: Fibonacci Sequence
// Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (starting from 0 and 1).
//
// Remember to break down the problems into smaller steps, and don't hesitate to ask for help or search for resources if you get stuck. Happy coding!
